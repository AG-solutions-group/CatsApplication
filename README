CatsApplication

To whom it may concern,

my initial idea was to create a grid displaying images of all cat breeds as the search screen. However, the API doesn't provide a sample image when fetching the breeds, necessitating an additional API call for each breed's sample picture. To avoid excessive API calls, I limited the cat breeds to 12.

The implemented pagination for the lists for each breed was unnecessary, as the avarage number of provided pictures is minimal.

Due to time constraints, the following stretch goals were not implemented:

In-memory caching of network results
Animating UI changes
Only a basic design was implemented as a result of the limitations above.

The brevity of the project made using version control for things as commits, except for the initial, unnecessary.

Thank you for your time!
